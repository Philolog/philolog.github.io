**Philo Alexandrinus** is a Jewish thinker who lived in Alexandria in the first half of the first century BCE. Whether he really was a philosopher is a question still debated at length. At the beginning of the Roman Empire, especially for the Stoics and the Cynics, the fundamental task of a philosopher was the construction of his own self. A man who sought to improve himself had to first regulate his own nature, controlling his passions and emotions and eliminating any gap between theory and practice. He was thus supposed to approach the perfection of a god. To the exact contrary of this attitude, Philo’s purpose was to prove the oudeneia, the ontological nothingness of human beings. In his opinion, the only way to have real existence was to admit that one is nothing without the help of God, who is the source of freedom, logos (reason) and consciousness. He aimed to be the best possible servant of the Revelation and of the text that forms God’s Word. He accepted contradiction as a normal means of expression, which serves as a possible explanation for the disordered impression of his treatises. He was, however, neither ignorant nor confused; rather, he consciously deconstructed the rationalist patterns of Greek thought, which in his opinion served to affirm the primacy of the self. He did not want to get rid of logos but rather to place it clearly within the unique perspective of divine transcendence. Though he felt great admiration for Plato, his transcendence was not exactly Platonic, but rather of a God both absolutely unknowable yet very close to mankind. Nikiprowetzky (1977) inaugurated a new era in Philonian studies by affirming the centrality of the Law in the Philo’s thought. In this perspective, philosophy was the servant of Revelation, a way to lend his exegesis a more universal impact by drawing upon the categories of Greek logos One of the purposes of our presentation will be to give a plausible evaluation of the many images and interpretations of Philo that we find in Philonian scholarship.
