at the beginning of 2022 i decided to master my python skills, so i did a big research and chose <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/">100 days of code: the complete python pro bootcamp for 2022</a> on udemy. i really recomend that course for everyone who want good understand what programming is and want to learn python. i'm still on the road, and i'm not going to give up. below are all the simple projects that i made myself while studying. you can find the entire database of my programming projects on my <a href="https://replit.com/@Philolog/"><b>replit profile</b></a>.
